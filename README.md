# ComputerCraft
A clicker game where you are in charge of a start-up computer company

# How the game works
At first you unlock the most basic computer features. You are then able to buy and assemble these features by clicking a button. This will cost money so you need to keep an eye out for you balance. You can then sell the computers to gain a slight profit by clicking another button. 

There are also certain upgrades you can purchase. You can upgrade the individual parts of the computer to increase the sell price, you can purchase factories to increase the number of computers assembled every click and you can upgrade your transportation to increase the number of computers sold every click.

# State of the game
I am still developing this game which means i am currently working on the layout and visuals of this game. I would appreciate it if suggestions could be made of what i could change and general feedback on how the game looks like (please no comments on function as nothing works at the moment!).
